 After winning the hearts of the audience with his social drama 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha' which revolved around governmental campaigns to improve the sanitation conditions, with an emphasis on the eradication of open defecation, especially in rural areas, Akshay Kumar is back with yet another thought-provoking film 'PadMan' that deals with menstruation and sanitary hygiene.

According to a recent report on BoxofficeIndia.com, the R. Balki film has raked in an astounding amount of Rs 62 crore in its first week at the ticket counter.


'PadMan' was envisioned to be an awareness film without focusing on commercial aspects. The producers' main agenda was to reach out to a wide audience to create awareness and eradicate prevalent superstitions in India surrounding sanitary pads.


The film which is based on the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham also stars Sonam Kapoor and Radhika Apte in pivotal roles and has been doing well in Mumbai and Bangalore. Even the entire Bollywood came out in support of Akshay and took his challenge by posting pictures of themselves with sanitary pads on their respective social media handles.
